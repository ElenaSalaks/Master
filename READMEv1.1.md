## Stuff to know


Likely we work together in some capacity and so you may find the below useful:

1.	My work hours are sporadic. Where I once held a predictable work structure, I have found the lines between work and life outside of work become increasingly blurred, fluid, and integrated. 
    1. I am an early riser. I sometimes jump online before my morning run, and before my mom-teacher-duties are in full swing.
    1. My children are at an age where they really benefit from 1:1 time to learn. Currently they’re responding better to structure earlier in the day so I’ve been setting different time blocks to make sure we at least address some of the fundamentals like reading, writing, and math. Where possible, I try to do this outside a “normal” workday, but that isn’t always possible. Currently 7am seems to be a good reading hour and 10am a good math worksheet hour. 
    1. I am also doing video chats at 11 with my dad who is currently recovering from COVID-19. Hospital staff are certainly heroes, but not always punctual. 
    1. Where before I was able to squeeze in some late nights, I now find myself ready to pass out from exhaustion when the clock strikes 10. That isn’t always the case though. Sometimes I have a hard time sleeping and so getting through some emails at a crazy hour seems as good of a time as any.  If you receive an email or IM from me at night then the right interpretation is “because Elena is doing work on her schedule” rather than “Elena wants an answer right now”.
    1. I don’t really know what balance means anymore. I suppose it’s whether I feel like I haven’t completely neglected my love ones or the work I love.  This is what balance means to me. You do you.

1. As long as you do great work, have integrity, and are respectful of your peers; I am not particular about what your work schedule is, or from where you decide to work.
    1. In general, I have a love/hate relationship with email. If you are writing an essay, consider creating a separate artifact. And if I need your attention on something with tremendous urgency, I’ll not be expecting you to find that out by checking your email.
    1. Working long hours doesn’t impress me. Trust that you got hired because of the contribution you are making within a reasonable timeframe. And I will trust that you are using your time wisely. 
    1. If we need to make adjustments to what a workday looks like, let’s do so. Whether it’s later workhours so you can FaceTime with loved ones overseas, or more fragments spread throughout the day, I’m confident we can find a solution that works. 
    1. Alot of the contributions we make is immeasurable. Whatever your deliverable(s) may be, how you achieve it is just as important. Try not to be an a**hole.

1. The [Eisenhower Matrix](http://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/)(urgency/significance) is as important as ever as you may get pulled into multiple asks from folks who may have extra time on their hands and want to finally get started on a project.  If you are not familiar, be aware that not everything you’re asked to do Urgently is actually Significant; and that there is Significant non-Urgent stuff which nobody is bugging you for. Prioritize accordingly.
    1. Everyone and everything will demand your time. It will be up to you to be constantly vigilant as to where you’re spending your effort. Resist the lure of low-effort but low-impact work. I am a work in progress here myself.  Useful perspective/feedback I received here is: "significant" is "stuff that in a year's time you'll (a) remember you did; and (b) be glad you did."
    1. There will always be stuff which doesn’t get done; the trick is make sure it’s the right stuff not to get done. It may be useful to keep a To Do list of the stuff which needs doing. Stack rank it, and don’t worry if stuff further down on this list doesn’t get done. All we can do is try. I once saw a kindergarten poster that sums this up perfectly: “It’s okay that it’s not perfect. But it’s not okay not to try.”
    1. If you’re overloaded or not sure what to prioritize, let’s chat. I’m invested in your success.

To summarize, I believe we can do great work together. I strive for excellence in my work but recognize I am far from perfect. Let me know how I can be better.
