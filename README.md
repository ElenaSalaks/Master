## Stuff to know


Likely we work together in some capacity and so you may find the below useful:

1. I generally work ~9am–~5pm PT, and then sporadically late at night or early morning. The time in between I aim to reserve for me, my family, and my passion projects.
    1. I am an early riser. I sometimes jump online before my morning run, and before my mom-duties are in full swing (I usually tackle drop-offs and my spouse does pick-up duty). 
    1. As I learn more about my own peak-performance times, I am trying to do less late nights. If you receive an email or IM from me at night then the right interpretation is “because Elena is doing work on her schedule” rather than “Elena wants an answer right now”.
    1. I won’t be responsive if you catch me during a time when I am around my children. This is what balance means to me. You do you.



1. As long as you do great work, have integrity, and are respectful of your peers; I am not particular about what your work schedule is, or from where you decide to work. 
    1. In general, I have a love/hate relationship with email. If you are writing an essay, consider creating a separate artifact. And if need your attention on something with tremendous urgency, I’ll not be expecting you to find that out by checking your email.
    1.	Working long hours doesn’t impress me. Trust that you got hired because of the contribution you are making within a reasonable timeframe. And I will trust that you are using your time wisely. 
    1. Alot of the contributions we make is immeasurable. Whatever your deliverable(s) may be, how you achieve it is just as important. Try not to be an a**hole.


1. I love that the team I’m on has embraced the [Eisenhower Matrix](http://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/)    (urgency/significance). If you are not familiar, be aware that not everything you’re asked to do Urgently is actually Significant; and that there is Significant non-Urgent stuff which nobody is bugging you for. Prioritize accordingly.
    1. Everyone and everything will demand your time. It will be up to you to be constantly vigilant as to where you’re spending your effort. Resist the lure of low-effort but low-impact work. I am a work in progress here myself.  Useful perspective/feedback I received here is: "significant" is "stuff that in a year's time you'll (a) remember you did; and (b) be glad you did."
    1. There will always be stuff which doesn’t get done; the trick is make sure it’s the right stuff not to get done. It may be useful to keep a To Do list of the stuff which needs doing. Stack rank it, and don’t worry if stuff further down on this list doesn’t get done. All we can do is try. I once saw a kindergarten poster that sums this up perfectly: “It’s okay that it’s not perfect. But it’s not okay not to try.”
    1. If you’re overloaded or not sure what to prioritize, let’s chat. I’m invested in your success.

To summarize, I believe we can do great work together. I strive for excellence in my work but recognize I am far from perfect. Let me know how I can be better.
